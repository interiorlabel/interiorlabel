        <p class="clickable-text first-paragraph" id="protocol-sentence">I believe in the progress of music. I believe in forgetting the term musicality, and expanding the fields of hearing and sound beyond. Industrialization and the modern world introduced humans to new sounds, sounds that could only be produced synthetically (não-natural). The term synthetic doesn't apply only to synthesizers or test equipments, what I mean by synthetic are all forms of post-industrial sounds, noises sourced/synthesized from a world where machinery and humans have no choice but to communicate.</p>
        <p class="second-paragraph">Society is now on a constant loop, where the masses find themselves in a passive position, as Adorno would state. Musicality and traditional methods of composing have focused on pleasure, or working around pleasure. The issue is, in a world where pleasure is so sought after, especially when there has been a constant increase of mental health disorders, the industry has found a way to discard critical thinking, and as a consequence, capture more slaves. Thus, I reinforce the urgent need of getting rid of all the traditional methods, and proceeding to exploring all the new sonic possibilities of the industrial world</p>
